meta-description: How this website was build
---

This website is written various technologies: [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) for creating the CSS,
[fancybox 2](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/) for the images,
[rsync](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) for fast uploading of the,
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) the
format in which I'm writing blog posts, [sweetie gem](https://github.com/matthias-guenther/sweetie)
for gathering different information of a Jekyll project, and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for
creating the website. For fast hacking and creating new blog posts on the fly [Vim](http://www.vim.org) is my advocate.


I crafted the website in such a way that you can view it easily on your mobile device such as iPhone or iPad.
