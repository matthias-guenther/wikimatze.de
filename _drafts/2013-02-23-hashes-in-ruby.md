**

A hash is a data structure to store data as key/value pairs. Where elements of an array are referenced via their
index, hashes access elements by their keys. Keys in hashes can be any object.

Hashes are fast you have constant time to look up an element.


## Examples


```ruby
{}.class # => Hash
```


The keys of a hash are separated from their values with a hash rocket `=>`. The key is on the left side of the
operator and the value on the right side.
