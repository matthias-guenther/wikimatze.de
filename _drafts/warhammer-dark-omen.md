You know these tiny little figures. They stand all over the table just to block your route through
your room.  There are so many of them on the ground or the treble that you can hardly set a foot
without trembling the great scenery. Some of them are painted, other are blank like metal and other
standing in gorgeous heroic poses. Welcome to the dark grim world of Warhammer. It's a world full of
background, expensive figures and vast battles (only if you have enough space.). For guys which
don't have time (or motivation) to play this tabletop game in reality here is your chance to get
your hands on some hard.


## What the game is about

Your are commander Morgan Bernhard and guiding the famous *Grudebringer Cavalry* into battles to
earn mostly coin and less honor. During the battle the you track your progress on the world map. On
your travel you will encounter several famous personalities for example Emperor *Karl-Franz*, the
ruler of the Empire or *Manfred von Carstein*. Before every battle starts you have time to make the
formation for your troops. You must consider sight and the terrain: A canon (or any other of your
long-range combat units) on a hill has a much higher range than on the field. Be careful about
friendly fire: You will more than often shout a "Duh" if the mortar is firing directly into your
expensive *Knight Panthers*. If you are made all your preparations for battle it's time to start the
struggle. "Engage", "Halt" and "Fire" are the most commands you will give to your troops via mouse.
Let you Bihanders fight against the *Undead*, look with how *Dwarfs* crushes into the *Greenskins*
beware of the magic (which are very mighty in the game), launch surprise attacks, have an eye on
psychology, ambush in the flank or back are great opportunities for you to annihilate your enemies.


After each fight your troops will gain experience and you get paid. for your efforts. Your regiments
will get stronger so you can buy them better armor. But beware, the better the protection of your
troops is, the replacement of casualties will be much higher only if you have enough coins left.
It's a good strategy to have some canon fodder only to give the enemy the deathblow with your "*high
suited goldies*". If you should loose a whole regiment on the battle ground than it is lost for the
rest of the campaign. Consider to restart the battle because without some regiments you can hardly
gain a glorious victory especially the last battle in the game.


## What does it looks and sound like

Trees, snow, murky caverns and water - nearly every facet can be discovered through your adventure.
The whole styling catches the pictures of the charming the Warhammer universe. Yeah the models look
like a pixel salad: Orks are green, Undead bleached like bone and Humans colorful like the rainbow.
But with there typical sound samples of the characters and the regiments you get the right feeling
to be directly into the battle. You get these strange feeling you are warped back in your childhood.


## Opinion

Have to play a battle more than 10 times? Hell I love to do it again and you ask why? Let me explain
this with some more questions. Why must land the mortar it's last bomb directly into my cavalry?
Shocked about the difficult battle, the pressure, not to stop the battle to give individual orders
to your troops? And pleased with the great voices of the characters? These are the things, which
caught my attention. During the game your regiments are developing there own personality and that is
the main cause why you have the motivation to start the scenario again and again until you have
nearly lost a men (except the cannon fodder of course).
