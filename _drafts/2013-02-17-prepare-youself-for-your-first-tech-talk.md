## Finding a place to stay

One possibility is to find a hotel and have a place to be on your own. But the tempation is to strong to not hang out
with your fellow hackers.


Instead Send out a tweet asking if there's a local who could offer you a couch. Copy @rubymidwest at the end of the
tweet.  They will likely retweet it and many conference goers will see that and offer you a place to stay.


If you insist of staying at some place please refer to vrbo.com or AirBnB to find something which is not too expensive.


## Travel equipment

Stay lighweight so that you are agile and don't have to think on too many things at once


## Take pictures for the people in your hometown

Explain zach holmans app which helps you to track the locations of your. And of course you need a "Spiegelreflex-Camera"


## Finding the Right presentation Software

I have used everything and nothing worked good in all points.


I'm not into the [prezi](http://prezi.com/) movement but I finally found my solution with
[impress.js](http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js). If you don't want to code your presentations on your own you can use
[Strut](http://tantaman.github.com/Strut/dist/index.html) to create your presentations in a prezi way after which you
are able to change colors and fonts after you are ready at the conference.


The most professionals out there are using [keynote](http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/)


Hand drawn slides are nice.  I have zero drawing skills. Maybe less.  So I wouldn't try it.  But if you can pull it
off, good for you.  About the only tip I would give here is don't do it so well that it takes away from them paying
attention to you.  ;)  Use slides to get your point across.  Avoid distractions.


## Practising your talk

Give your talk at local user group and don't forget to ask for feedback because without you can't become better.

Practiced my talk in google hangouts with hackers I know, so that they could give me feedback.


## The Question About Becomming A Speaker

Everybody has a different story to tell. o


Here is my story: Think how I enjoyed giving presentation at home and how thwe


I think audiences want to feel comfortable with a speaker—they need to feel the speaker is confident, knowledgable, and
understanding of their problems. Different speakers achieve this in different ways—some use humor, some use deep
technical knowledge, and some just have charisma. Which you use depends on your personality.


But the _reason_ to do it is probably the same. Do it because you are driven to communicate.


## Conclusion

You are a programmer.  So is your audience.  If you ran into them in the hall, you could easily strike up a conversation
about your shared interests.  You would both likely enjoy that.

Giving a speech should be similar to that.  You're just telling us about something you are excited about that you think
we might enjoy too.  Do that a lot like you would try to do in the hall.  Warn us about problem areas to avoid.  Slip in
some power tips that really help you.  Hook us.
