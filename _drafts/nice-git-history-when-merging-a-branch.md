# Nice git history when merging a branch
Use `git merge --no-ff origin/symlink-with-auto-mhClear` instead of a
plain `git merge origin/symlink-with-auto-mhClear`

Why? The --no-ff means that not the forwarding strategy will be used for
merging commits into master but instead the recursive strategy which
will display the commits in the branch as an extra history in the view
of the project.
