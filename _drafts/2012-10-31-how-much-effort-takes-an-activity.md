*This article describe my motivation to become a Pomodoro Master. This article describes who you can measure the effort a task
needs.*


## Learn to estimate you Pomodoros

Before you start working on task think for a while: How much Pomodoro (we are not speaking of time in traditional way here, to make
our effort measurable) do I need for the task? If you have a number in mind, write it down and see how many Pomodoros you need in
the end. For every Pomodoro you estimated for the task make a square for it. If one Pomodoro is over, make a cross in the square.

Example: In my work we have to solve bugs. When we are standing in front of it and read the headline and what should be fixed,
I'm writing down my estimated Pomodoros for it. After that I will, see if I'm was right or wrong. Why should you do this? First
you became aware of how much time you need for this task. Second, Pomodoros provide you a metric which you can evaluate
search for critical paths and . Finally you can give better estimation at the end for each sprint which helps
your management to make more reliable plans. I will not save you, that you will create better estimations for each situation but
it makes you a better programmer.


## Example of overestimation

Imagine you have to design a print CSS for a certain design. From previous work you know that it can take several days or only
one day - it is a matter of the layout and the browser behavior you need to support.
Let's say you estimate for such a task around 8 Pomodoros but in the end you need only 2 - that made a -6 estimates of
Pomodoros. That's bad, I know but you and your team will learn from it.


## Example of underestimation

Let's say you are confronted with the sort of a bug that you have solved in the past very quickly. You estimate 2 Pomodoros for
solving it. When you tackle the problem you detect a smell in the design that you have to change. Because you have no
unit tests at hand, you need to write tests first before changing the design. That takes a little time. After you have written
the tests you detect a flaw in the design - you decide according to your profession to make a huge change in the design. That takes another amount of your time but will save your company, your workmates, and yourself time. In the end the task took + 6 Pomodoros.


## Balance between over- and underestimation

If you count the numbers from the example above, and count them together (-6 + 6), you see that the balance between over-and
underestimation is zero. Thats perfect and that's what you should always aim for at the end of a day or sprint.  If this is not
the case you should think about it and try to break down bigger tasks into smaller one.


## Conclusion

In the beginning I saw no sense in estimating my task. My mantra was to just using the Pomodoro technique for tasks and have
regularly breaks to prevent mental exhausting. What I didn't know, how much I will have to spend. So I started making these
little squares as often as I can. The benefit of using this made me a better at User-Story Estimations - if a Product Owner asks
me now how long somethings takes, I can give them more valuable feedback. Of course, if I have to work on something completely new
and can't say that I can fix it in one day, I'm estimating in days.If the tasks are so big, you have to make them so small that
you can guess between 1 ~ 6 Pomodorors - so 6 Pomodoros are approximately three hours.
