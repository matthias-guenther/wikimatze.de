# canonical_urls

Here some information about canonical urls:
* as mentioned above they are used to prevent duplicated content (like http://www.your_page.de https://www.yourpage.de
* the url in our project: http://en.ses.com.lvh.me:3000/4232583/en-test should have the canonical url <link rel="canonical" href="http://en.ses.com.lvh.me:3000/4232583/en" />

benefits of using canoni:
* the reputation of the old page will be handed to the new page
* google page rank wil not be distributed over several pages with nearly same content
* support for several robots engine (yahoo, Bing)

h3. Conclusion

In essence, you're telling the engines that multiple pages should be considered as one (which a 301 does), without actually redirecting visitors to the new URL (often saving your dev staff considerable heartache).
