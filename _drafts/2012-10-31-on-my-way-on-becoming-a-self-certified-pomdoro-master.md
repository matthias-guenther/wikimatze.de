title: On My Way On Becoming a Self-Certified Pomodoro Master
meta-description: Motivation for the ongoing series of becoming a Self-Certiefied Pomodoro Master
---

*This article series describes the necessary steps for becoming a "Self Certified Pomodoro Master". Since the Pomodoro
Technique is a self-driven approach to becoming the master of your time, why shouldn't you be able to self-certify as a
Pomodoro Master?*


Each article will be a small step in mastering the technique, just as the technique emphasizes small steps. I start the
series with an explanation of my motivation for doing this and a description of my first experience with "doing a
Pomodoro". You will learn the six objectives for mastering the Pomodoro Technique, and I'll share the problems I ran
into and how I solved them.


## Why?

In the beginning 2012 I became very unsatisfied with the state of my current work flow.  Meetings, little questions from
workmates, phone calls, service complains, and new feature requests from my product owner were always jumping on my
daily schedule with all the demand for attention of a rock star leaping onto the stage. It was no surprise that I wasn't
able to write a single line of code before lunch. But even if it wasn't suprising, it was unacceptable.


Something was wrong, but what? Was it me? Was it my environment? Or was it a mix of both? I had to find it out. Since we
programmers love solving problems, I approached it as a problem to solve, and at the end of the day I was asking the
simple question: What did I do this day? Often I got the feeling that I had done nothing.

You can imagine how unsatisfying this feeling was. Most of us programmers want to be productive and get things done. I
remembered reading in ["The Pragmatic Programmer"](http://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer) by Andrew Hunt
and David Thomas, that context shifting steals your valuable time because you need a certain amount of time to get back
into working mode. I also remembered reading about a very simple approach in the book ["Agile
Coaching"](http://pragprog.com/book/sdcoach/agile-coaching) by Rachel Davies and Liz Sedley mentioned a simple time
management technique called the "Pomodoro Technique". Just give it try, I have nothing to lose.


## The First Pomodoro

I spend an evening browsing the web to find resources about the technique ([Pomodoro Book
pdf](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/book/)), and was glad to discover that the inventor of the technique had released
a free book that explains the basic methods and mindset behind it. I read the book in one evening and was motivated to
apply its ideas at work the next following day.


Without getting into organizational tools of the technique like the *Inventory Sheet* and *To-Do-Today Sheet*, I just
wanted to focus, at first, on the discipline of working for **25 minutes**, called by users of the technique "one
Pomodoro." (Don't worry, I will explain the terms *"Inventory Sheet"* and *"To-Do-Today Sheet"* in the following
articles).I wanted to see what happened when I tried to work concentratedly for 25 minutes.


What happened was that I make one stroke, then another, and then another. No, I didn't have a stroke. Strokes are
indicators that you log during your Pomodoro.


After working more or less focused on the task for 25 minutes, I got my five-minute break. And I was happy to have it. I
counted the strokes I had made during the session and got a clear picture of what was going on: My total of eleven
strokes were a strong indicator that I couldn't work effectively even for this small period of time. Bam, not scientific
evidence, but a metric I can use for further experiments.

What I learned during my first Pomodoro was that, even with the distraction, I was able to concentrate on solving the
specified task within the 25-minute time limit.  After running additional Pomodoros I started to get used to this tiny
timeframe for a task, and because I was now aware of and recording the many distraction I had to deal with, I got that
feeling of producing value at the end of the day back.


But I knew that I was only at the beginning of the process of the using the Pomodoro Technique more professionally and
can do much better.


## Following the six objectives

In order to become an Master of the Pomodoro Technique, you have to follow a path. My excellent guide on the path was an
article on the [Pomodoro World website](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/certification/). Here is the list of the six
steps you need to take in order to become a Pomodoro Master:


1. Getting the basic equipment.
2. Learn how much effort an activity takes.
3. Try to remove interruptions.
4. Learn to estimate (basically how much Pomodoros a task need).
5. Sharpen your Pomodoro and learn who to structure them.
6. Set up a timetable for your Pomodoros.


My goal is to master each of these steps them in a month and write about my observations in doing so.


## Conclusion

If you are feeling the pain of impaired productivity in your daily work, it is important to fight against it. Talk to
other people, read a book about it, or just start writing about your observations to get a better understanding of
what's going on. Whatever you do, you need to leave your comfort zone try something new -- for example, the Pomodoro
Technique.
