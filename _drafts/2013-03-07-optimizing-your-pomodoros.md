*To get most out of the Pomodoro Technique you need to modifiy the essential components of it.*


## Structure your Pomodoro

A normal Pomodoro takes 25 minutes. Normally you should constantly work for this time on your work unit. But sometimes
it's difficult to continue the progress of the previous Pomodoro when a task takes more than one Pomodoro. Where did you leave? What did you learn?


Try to repeat within the first couple of minutes of the new Pomodoro what you've learned and where you left off. This
anchor will help your brain to reestablish context. Seeing the results of the previous session will keep your senses
sharp like a saw. If you were running in the wrong direction, you'll more kikely see that it's time to get on the right track to try
another way.


If you are at last three minutes of your Pomodoro, try recapping what you've done. Recap what happened, were you went, how
you move and how effective it was. Even small reflections are important to improve yourself.


[James Grenning](http://www.renaissancesoftware.net/blog/) once said: "Change is difficult, but the only way to improve
is change." You may think that the overhead of review and recap after the start and right at the end of a Pomodoro is
waste of valueable time. And you're right that it does cut into directly productive work. But these are also the perfect times for asking questions to
change that can lead to your to your changing what is not working. If you discover something like "Searching works bad in Vim or I'm losing focus because I
have to switch between keyboard and mouse to often" write those things down. These impediments are early indicators on
how you can reach the next level of productivity in your workflow. Try `:help` in Vim or buy Brian P. Hogan's book [tmux: Productive
Mouse-Free Development](http://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux) to lower context switching between mouse and keyboard.


I find it very good to speak my observations loud out while talking to a team member. Systematic questions and
repetition of what you've learned will help to memorize new information.


## Timetable your Pomodoros throughout the day

Timetables help you to define day goals and limits the things you try to do today. On a normal day, you look how much time you have for work? Knowing this makes it easier for you to see where you can do unexpected things that happen during the day and a placed in your *unplanned activities section*.


Having figured that out, it is important to see how many Pomodoros you can do during the day and see how much you
achieved. If things don't work out the way you like, find the causes for this. Consider them for your planning of the
next day.


This is how I'm planning my workday: I start at 8 am. It's normally not before 10 am till everybody is in the office, so I
have four Pomodoros for concentrated working. This is mostly the only time during the day I'm feeling highly productive.
After that I have a small break for 10 minutes to get something to eat until we have our daily standup between
10.15 kam. After that we have our company standup around 10.35 am. Then I'm having 2 or three Pomodoros left till
lunch. After lunch between I have six Pomodoros left until my workday is over. But these 6 Pomodoros are
hardly to achieve because there are meetings and I'm helping other teams and workmates with problems. So I do the urgent
and important stuff (even bugs) before everyone is in the office. I can report the progress I made to my team and can
say what I'm planning for the rest of day and what I already did. This leaves me a good feeling of achieved something and
can report the result to my team members.


## Team Pomodoros

When I first gave a presentation about the Pomodoro Technique I was asked if you can do team Pomodoros. Well I was
rushed about this questions and never considered doing it. After giving the talk I talked to several people about it.
They were pair-programming the whole day and they were changing roles constantly. So after 25 minutes they would
switching keyboards and let the other person do the work. The interesting thing about it was that you have your breaks
during the work but still helping your co-workers get things done.


Don't worry if you get the keyboard at point during your sessions where you don't have a clue what you should do next.
Leaving your comfort zone makes your brain work harder and your comrade will help you.


I liked the idea but didn't had the time to try this into practice. I will cover this topic in a future article.


So, to wrap up: Try to vary the steps in the Pomodoro Technique. Once you get used to certain parts of it, you can try new ideas like
structuring your days after the available Pomodoros or try Team-Pomodoros to maximize your productivity. As the Roman poet [Ovid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid) once said " Add little to little and there will be a big
pile." Try something new and see if it's working for you. How knows, it can be maybe something completely different from
the Pomodoro Technique and you create a technique on your own.
