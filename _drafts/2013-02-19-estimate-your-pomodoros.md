title: Estimate Your Pomodoros

If you have followed my article series to this point you should know the rudiments of how to use the Pomodoro to get
control of your time. You know what Pomodoros are, how to run them, and how you can defend yourself from interruptions.


In this installment you will learn how you can better estimate your time for doing Pomodoros.


## Is Estimation Evil?

I have to do it every sprint at work and nearly every time it is difficult for every one in the team: Estimation.


If you are the Product Manager, you need estimates from the developer about features in order to prioritize them. You
will use this information to determine how much effort it takes to build the feature and how much business value will be
generated for the customer. This is part of the benefit cost analysis. You will use this information to create a release
plan of your backlog. For example you want your marketing people to advertise the new feature to the users just in time
and communicate it when it's out and not the other way round. We all know that just-in-time is expected but difficult to
achieve. The only constant thing in software development is change and so we know that the requirements will change and
with them your plans.


Knowing all the requirements of a feature is almost impossible. There will be always uncertain variables:


- some of your teammates get the flu,
- the Product Manager is stuck for the whole week in meetings and isn't available for questions
- developers have problems with infrastructure because the system team is doing some important migrating job
- or you are fighting very nasty bad bugs, or you detect during the implementation that the design needs a whole refactoring that needs to be done, or ...
- I'm sure can think some of these things on your own.


All developers knows about and expect these kinds of problems. But we tend to underestimate the time we need to solve
the problems and we almost forget the unknown obstacle which will appear in some way. As a developer you have to chose a
strategy to solve the problem, build the thing, and show it to your customer, and the sooner the better. Getting early
feedback gives you a chance to adopt your feature to changes in the requirements instead of building it
in the wrong direction. This will save you time and money.


You need a plan for doing things but you know that your plan will not work in the way you want. You'll have to adopt it
in small steps. You can learn more about this topic by [Ron Jeffries](http://xprogramming.com/index.php)

Let's se what the Pomodoro Technique has to offer.


## Make Estimations in Pomodoros

Remember the *Activity Inventory Sheet*? Right, it's the piece of paper which is the gathering of all the
things you want to do today. There is a special column in the sheet where you can draw boxes. Each box stands for
a Pomodoro. There you have your estimation guessing area for each task. When one Pomodoro is over you are making a cross
in the next box. Each crossed box stands for one Pomodoro you've spend on the task.

<div class="Your first estimation"></div>


The first imageabove shows the task "Ruby Midwest talk". It has four boxes. That means that I think that I need four
Pomodoros to prepare the talk. Since I haven't started any Pomodoros for this task, the boxes are empty.


You may ask what the perfect size for a task should be? In my eyes something between 1 - 4 Pomodoros is a perfect fit.
If you think a task takes more then 4 Pomodoros it is actually too big and should be break down. Splitting up big
problems is like climbing mountains - taking small steps safes you from falling down and you will have enough time to
think over your route, and you will have more time to make some pictures during your trip. The smaller the problem is
the better you are able to estimate.


## Determine your available Pomodoros For A Day

Before writing down your estimations for the each task you first need to determine how many Pomodoros you have
today. A bad day may only consists of four Pomodoros for concentrated working.


On nice days, where you have the feeling that you are actually working, you have between 8 - 13 Pomodoros. These are
times where you are feeling the team spirit, leaving your comfort zone, reaching for the stars, and making the
impossible deadline possible. You are happy to do your beloved programming job.


Have your "available-Pomodoro-number-per-day" in mind before you create a list with task for the day. Think of these
tasks as a commitment (or "promise" to say it in with the words of [Uncle Bob](https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin)) for
day. The nice side effect of this strategy is that you are limiting yourself about the things you can really finished
per day. [Kanban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) describe this way of working with "Stop Starting, Start
Finishing".


## Tracking Your Estimation Progress

<a href="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8383/8495962086_a65c68aee6_b.jpg" title="At the end of the day " class="fancybox"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8383/8495962086_a65c68aee6_c.jpg" class="center" alt="At the end of the day "/></a>
<div class="At the end of the day "></div>


At the end of the day you should have have a list like the one in the next image. As you can see there are tasks where
not all boxes are crossed. These are tasks that took less time that you thought in the beginning (**overestimation**).
If there are more crosses then boxes beside a task you have take more time that you estimated for it
(**underestimation**).


At work I'm tracking the time I need to solve a problem. Instead of thinking in a classical time estimating, I'm
Pomodoros as my metric. At the beginning I may have had 4 or more at some task because I was working in hostile
environment without any tests and very old legacy code. It was more than 5 year old code and all comments were wrong. If
you are not experienced with this kind of work you can triplicate the time you think you need at the beginning.


<a href="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8225/8495960732_974c16b1cb.jpg" title="Picture of the Record Sheet" class="fancybox"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8225/8495960732_974c16b1cb.jpg" class="center" alt="Picture of the Record Sheet"/></a>
<div class="Picture of the Record Sheet"></div>


You can track your estimates on the *Record Sheet* (see the image above). The difference between estimated and real
shows you how well you estimated your task. If the difference are between -2 to +2 you are actually pretty good at
estimating.


I'm not using the *Record Sheet* yet. I'm only using the Activity Inventory Sheet to track the estimations of my
Pomodoros.  Out of historical data I can say that I'm a much better estimator before I was using the Technique. The most
important thing is to recognize when and why you need so long for a task. Was it due the lack of skill, due to some
stupid decision, because you didn't talk to anyone about the way you want to solve the problem, or
were you solving the wrong problem? We all make mistakes, and mistakes are the best fertile ground to build up
your developer skills.


Don't give up if you are having a huge gap between the estimated and needed Pomodoros. This will work better if you keep
practicing it.


## Conclusion

Estimation are one of the things programmer hate. We all have trouble predicting the time we need for a story or single
task. Only after running a marathon you know how long it took. It is the same if you are working with your team on a
long term project. Only when you are finished with it do you know where the bottlenecks were. Apparently every large
project in the IT is different and difficult to estimate, and there will be external dependencies of unforeseen
problems which will destroy you plan.  [Edmund Burke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke) summarizes this
perfectly with "You can never plan the future by the past."


By using the Pomodoro metric to track your commitment, you become better at estimating and at keeping
your promise for your users, Product Owner, Team, and yourself.
