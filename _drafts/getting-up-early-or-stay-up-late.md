title: Getting up early or stay up late
meta-description: Stay up and keep up the work

You know this typical prejudice of a geek super computer hacker. He's sitting in an absolutely soundproof room and
dislikes distraction from the outside world. To the right of his keyboard is a _DrPepper_ and a slice pizza. Of course
it's late in the afternoon and it seems that the great  hacker will spend his evening in front of his monitor. OK that's
enough in diving this (really?) old prejudice of a working freak. Why aren't there any geeks in the movies who start
working in the early morning yet? Why has it always been a dark grimy atmosphere for hackers in the late evening? Yeah
it's somehow the propagation of the media, but did you ever ask why?


h2. What's the difference?

Every person is an individual and that causes a lot of single "circadian rhythm". So you must know your own body, what a
person you are. For a long time I thought I was a person who could work most productive in the very early morning when
other persons are still sleeping or coming home after some funny bowling evening . During this time there is no
distraction and you can fully concentrate on your task without awaiting unexpected call or looking by working collegues
which ask you for a favor. You don't have to context switch which costs you effectively nearly half an hour before you
are again in your topic.


It has been a mistake of myself, that I believed a long time, that I just could work effectively in the morning. It's
the same when being mentally fit in the evening for some heavy brain work. As mentioned in the intro of this chapter it
depends on your body, how good do you know your body and the times you can work best. Let me explain the pro and cons of
working in the morning or in the evening:


*pros morning*
* Maybe you need some coffee before starting work.
* Before the day is really starting you have accomplished something and go higher motivated in the new day.
* No disturbance!
* You can concentrate on your task.
* If you get your work done you can have plenty of time in the afternoon for your children.
* It's also the best time to learn something new (or work on your own personal project).


*cons morning*
* Think of your girlfriend can't stand getting up early (you need an extra room and must slip through light out of the bed without waking up your beloved half).
* You need discipline to overcome your inner temptation.
* If you really stand up early in the morning, you will have a second breakfast (This may not be good for your body/constitution)
* You have to fight the envy looks of your comrades (and they will always ask you: "Dude you are crazy? Why don't you sleep in late because your work starts just 11 am?").
* In the evening you are normally exhausted and don't have the power to start something new (or to have a love-life with your spouse).


*pro evening*
* You can just write something if you ask me.
* Your day job is done and you now have enough time.
* Yeah the feeling is right it's better to start some work instead of just watching TV.


*cons evening*
* It's the end of the day, do you really have the constitution to start something new?
* Normally time for washing the dishes or watching TV.
* It's a good time for jogging (it's cool and there are not so many people outside which may disturb you).


h2. Conclusion

As I already mentioned there is always a trade-off which way you choose. Keep in mind that is the best to look at  booth sides of the medallion and decide which fits best for you! I first tried the variant in which I thought would be the worst in: working in early the morning. I wondered how wonderful it can be just to work four hours in the morning. I was amazed how my brain solved difficult tasks with just an ease and elegance. You are in the subject. And after working 4 hours on the topic, it felt after solving some "hydra bug" in less then half the time you normally need and you have no danger to get another hydra head.


After that I tried the variant in the evening and wondered: This can not be better than working in the morning. And I was right. Yeah I slept over a week enough to stay up very late, but in the end I just can not concentrate on working in the evening. It is dark and my body produce the hormones to get tired.


Don't think my argumentation above is good, it's just a description of my personal opinion. Have a look on your favorite fits.
