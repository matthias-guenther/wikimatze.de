title: Marketing Your Book Before You Start Writing It

**


Step 1: The very day when you have the idea of the book in your head, sit down,
        give the book a title, and write down who the book is for.

Step 2: The next step is to create a book cover. You can get that done on
        Fiverr.com for only $5.

Step 3: Place the image of your bookcover on your blog, on Facebook, or wherever you
        tend to hang out. You can say, "Hey, I’m writing this book" and build anticipation.
        It’s like the way big movies do it. You can see the trailer long before the film
        is ready for viewing.

Step 4: Create a short video or blog post about your book idea with an email signup form.
        Six months down the track when you’ve actually written the eBook, you’ll already
        have a group of customers waiting for it.
