- "*The best way to paralyze an opposition army is to ship it Powerpoint*" from Wall Street Journal saying about the
  inventor of Powerpoint
- approximately 10% of the computer science people can make appealing slides
- **Def of brands:** brands is what a company stands for in the hearts and minds of its customer and not only to present
  a tag-line, logo or slogan
- people can focus on one thing: listen to you or read the slides
- Mark Templeton: **"My goal is to say more with less word"**
- p 13: How much time it takes to create a presentation
- p 15: questions about your audience you must answer before starting your presentation
- "*The audience didn’t come to see; they come to see what you can do for them*"
- **Ingredients of great Slide-Design**:
  - background
  - color
  - text
  - images
- three seconds rule for a slide to deliver it's message
- use sans-serif font - they can be viewed best for presentations
- don't try to use bullets (and even sub-bullets)
- p 152: validation font-size, some weird methods of defining it (Guy Kawasaki has a very simple rule, if you ask me)
- use the **"Power of Constraints"** if you have to struggle with your presentation
- constraining the text: 3Rs
  - *Reduce* - choose per bullet one keyword and delete the rest
  - *Record* - read your slides out loud and record the delivery of your message
  - *Repeat* - repeat the content over and over again and memorized the missing information
- "*Great presenters connect with their audience, speak naturally and allow the slides to enhance their story*"
- navigating through your message with the mnemonic of architecture => think of going through a big building during your
  presentation
- constraining your presentation’s length forces you to be more concise and get rid of text-junk
- [Ted](http://www.ted.com) there are great speakers with marvelous presentation for your inspiration
- your top concern should be how well you communicate, not how good you look
