topicality of contents I can not take any responsibility. As a service provider I’m responsible
according to § 7 paragraph 1 of TMG for own contents on these pages under the general laws.
According to § 8 to 10 TMG I’m not obligated to control transmitted or stored information, or to
investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of
information under the general laws remain unaffected. A liability is only possible from the date of
knowledge of a specific infringement. On becoming aware of such violations, I will immediately
remove this content.


## Liability for links

This site contains links to external websites over which I have no control. The linked sites were
checked at the time of linking for possible violations of law. Illegal contents were not apparent at
the time of linking. A permanent control of the linked pages is unreasonable without concrete
evidence of a violation. Upon notification of violations, I will remove such links immediately.
