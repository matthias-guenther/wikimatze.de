  <ul>
<li>Shortcuts

<ul>
<li>POP = Point Of Purchase</li>
<li>PLC = Product Line Cycle</li>
<li>SP = Selling Price</li>
<li>SKU = Stock Keeping Unit</li>
<li>ADIs = Areas of Dominant Influence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>p 6: &ldquo;Buyers many times are different from users&rdquo; (e.g. women make the purchases for mens underwear in many cases)</li>
<li>p 6: <strong>buying process</strong>: <strong>Awareness</strong> (&ldquo;might need something&rdquo;) => <strong>Information Search</strong> (&ldquo;sounds good, lets find
more about it&rdquo;) => <strong>Evaluate Alternatives</strong> (&ldquo;which one is the best for me&rdquo;) => <strong>Purchase</strong> => <strong>Evaluate</strong></li>
<li>p 10: <strong>Consumer Behavior Matrix</strong>: High Involvement and Low Involvement</li>
<li>p 14: criteria to evaluate possible marketing segments

<ul>
<li><em>Measurability</em>: identify the segment, quantify the size of the segment</li>
<li><em>Accessibility</em>: reach the segment through advertising, transportation, warehousing, …</li>
<li><em>Substantially</em>: is the segment large enough to deal with it</li>
<li><em>Profitability</em>: are there enough potential profits there to make it worth to be a target</li>
<li><em>Compatibility with Competition</em>: Competitors interest in the segment, are they currently investigating in the
segment or is it not worth their trouble?</li>
<li><em>Effectiveness</em>: does the company have the capabilities to adequately service this segment</li>
<li><em>Defendability</em>: can you defend yourself against a competitor&rsquo;s attack</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>p 16: <strong>Market Analysis</strong>

<ul>
<li>What is the relevant market??</li>
<li>Where is the product in its PLC?</li>
<li>What are the key competitive factors in the industry?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>p 17: <strong>&ldquo;Only marketable products make money!&rdquo;</strong></li>
<li>p 20: <strong>key competitive factors</strong>: 1. Quality, 2. Price, 3.  Advertising, 4. Research and Development, 5. Service</li>

<ul>
<li>Strength, Weakness (internal factors)</li>
<li>Opportunities, Threats (external factors)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>p 22: <strong>&ldquo;If in an industry the barrier to entry are low, the playing field becomes crowded&rdquo;</strong></li>
<li>p 25: <em>blocking strategy</em>: Depth (company has many products within a category) and breath (company has many products
in a variety of product classes) of product lines can be used to prevent competitors from gaining access to the
channels of distribution. If they are not on the shelf, your competition can&rsquo;t make any sales.</li>
<li>p 25: <strong>&ldquo;What consumers believe is their reality&rdquo;</strong> => image of a product</li>
<li>p 28: &ldquo;Everyone who touches the merchandise takes a cut, which is called <em>margin</em>&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 31: Four C&rsquo;s of Internet marketing: commerce (allows sales 24/7 per week), content (the content of Web site is an
extension of the product), customer care (customers access their accounts, check deliveries), convert leads (convert
leads from your Internet and other marketing efforts, such as television, radio, and PR)</li>
<li>p 36; <strong>cooperative advertising</strong>: when manufacturers shares the cost of advertising with retailers</li>
<li>p 39: GRP = Reach x Frequency => this formula deals with advertising

<ul>
<li>GRP = gross rating points</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>p 51: sunk cost => dollars sunk in the ocean of the TV land</li>
<li>p 63: Forms of relativism: reasons to avoid making ethical decisions

<ul>
<li><strong>native relativism</strong>: every person has his own standard that enables him to make choices</li>
<li><strong>role relativism</strong>: distinguish between our private and public roles, example is fishing company who has to kill
fishes to earn money but his personal feelings are against it</li>
<li><strong>social relativism</strong>: people refer to social norms to render ethical judgments</li>
<li><strong>cultural relativism</strong>: holds that there is no universal moral code by which to judge another societies moral and
ethical standards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>p 66: steps to make stakeholder analysis</li>
<li>p 71: in biblical times the accountants kept track of how much grain was stored in the communities silos</li>
<li>p 72: <strong>Accounting</strong> answers the following questions about a business:

<ul>
<li>What does a company own?</li>

Feelings => Behavior</li>
<li>p 126: <strong>Expectancy theory</strong> outlines the factors that produce motivation with individuals</li>
<li>p 127: <strong>Motivation</strong> = Expectation of Work will lead to Performance x Expectation Performance will lead to Reward x
Value of Reward</li>
<li>p 127: <strong>Hertzberg</strong>, <strong>Maslow</strong> and <strong>McCloud</strong> have theories to explain behavior; so behavior is motivated by the
urge to satisfy needs</li>
<li>p 129: employee happiness is <strong>quality of work life</strong> and when the employees are given the chance to be all they can

<li>p 155: <strong>Change Management Strategies</strong>: Situation => Action Needed for Change</li>
<li>p 166: <strong>Cash Flow Analysis</strong>: &ldquo;What does the investment cost and how much cash will it generate each year?&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 172: <strong>Net Present Value</strong>: A dollar today is worth more than a dollar received in the future</li>
<li>p 207: <strong>Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</strong>: Determines the required rate of return of an investment by adding the
unsystematic risk and the systematic risk of owning this asset</li>
<li>p 214: <strong>Duration of a bond</strong>: Is the time the bond makes to return half of its market price to the investors</li>
<li>p 216: <strong>junk bond</strong>: is a bond that has high risk of default and they pay higher rates to investors</li>
<li>p 218: How to value Internet firms? These firms have no earnings and no dividends; see pages 218 – 221 => they are
very theoritical but it is possible to use them</li>
<li>p 219: <em>Prices-to-Sales Ratio </em>&ndash; In this formula stock price are divided by sales</li>
<li>p 219: <em>Asset Value per Share </em>&ndash; when a company&rsquo;s assets value divided by the outstanding shares is more valuable than

<li>p 223: <strong>Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model</strong> is standard for options valuations and an option&rsquo;s values is determined
by five factors

<ol>
<li>Time until expiration: the longer the option time, the more chance of a desired price movement</li>
<li>Different between the current stock price and the strike price: the closer the strike price is to the current
price the more probable it is that the current price movements can meet or exceed it by the expiration date</li>
<li>The price volatility of the stock: The more volatile the price movement of a stock, the more likely that a price
movement could jump near the strike price</li>
<li>Market rate of interest on short-term government securities: If the cost of financing the transactions is high,
then the option price has to be higher to cover the handling costs of the transaction</li>
<li>Dividend payments on the stock: Option owners do not collect the dividends on the underlying stock, but the stock
price that influences the option price is affected</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>p 226: Hedging is buying an option to offset a possible decline in value in an owned investment</li>
<li>p 226: Hedging is the cause why many people view the options market as a way to shift risk from one inventor to
another</li>
<li>p 228: <strong>Payback Period Method</strong> = Number of Years to recover initial investment</li>
<li>p 228: &ldquo;By accepting projects with longer paybacks, management accepts more risk&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 229: &ldquo;The further in the future a dollar is received, the greater the uncertainty that it will be reveived (risk)
and the greater the loss of opportunity to use those funds (opportunity costs)&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 229: NPV = Cash to be Received x (1 + Discount Rate)^(Number of Periods)

<ul>
<li>the NPV is flexible in making calculations that are useful in comparing different projects</li>
<li>when the investment is risky, a discount rate of 15-20% is suitable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>p 230 Profitability index (PI) = NPV of Future Cash Flow/Initial Investment

<ul>
<li>the NPV of Future Cash Flow is the sum of all NPVs</li>
<li>PI shows you the best group of projects</li>
<li>in situations where money is unlimited all PIs > 1.00 would be accepted</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>p 231 – 233: <strong>Five basic ways of financing a companys needs</strong>
