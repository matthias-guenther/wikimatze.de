  <ul>
<li>p xiii: Wisdom of adage: &ldquo;Build one to throw away&rdquo; that means after done something you how you
should have really done it</li>
<li>p 4: The major problems of our work are not so much technology as sociological in nature.</li>
<li>p 8: encourage people to make some errors</li>
<li>p 11: Think of the catalyst => a person which motivates people and made them more productive</li>
<li>p 16: Overtime is like sprinting: It make some sense for the last hundreds yards of the marathon
for those with any energy left, but if you start sprinting in the first mile, you&rsquo;re just wasting
time</li>
<li>p 17: you need to take a turnover into account whenever you set to gain higher productivity</li>
<li>p 18: People under time pressure don&rsquo;t work better &ndash; they just work faster</li>
<li>p 20: Workers kept under extreme time pressure will begin to sacrifice quality</li>
<li>p 21: The market doesn&rsquo;t give a damn about that much quality</li>
<li>p 29: Organizational busy work tensed to expand to fill the working day</li>
<li>p 33: <strong>the real work of software-developers: human communication to organize the users'
expressions of needs into formal procedures</strong></li>
<li>p 34: The manager&rsquo;s function: is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to
work</li>
<li>p 35: <strong>There are a million ways to lose a work day, but not even a single way to get one back</strong></li>
<li>p 49: environments and performers => if you have a quite place and have a private atmosphere
without disturbance you work better and have fine quality in the end</li>
<li>p 52: <strong>The Sheep Look Up</strong> by Brunner => people don&rsquo;t look at bad thing until it&rsquo;s to late</li>
<li>p 57: hiding out for work because the normal work environment is to loud</li>
<li>p 59: <strong>Gilbs Law</strong>: Anything you need to quantify can be measured in some way that is superior to
not measuring it at all</li>
<li>p 63: people need the <strong>flow mode</strong> to get really started to work so don&rsquo;t interrupt them to much</li>
<li>p 66: E-factor = uninterrupted hours/Body-present hours</li>
<li>p 99: <strong>Entroppy is always increasing in the organisation</strong>

<ul>
<li>entropy stands for sameness and the more an organization has the less potential is there to
generate energy or work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>p 110: You can do less damage to your organization by lining up the staff in front of a machine
gun than you do by moving</li>
<li>p 112: A common feature of companies with the lowest turnover is widespread retaining</li>
<li>p 114: Making a system deterministic will result in the loss of its ability to heal itself</li>
<li>p 114: Most of our organizations are only as good as the people who staff them</li>
<li>p 115 &ndash; 117: don&rsquo;t follow blind the Methodology, don&rsquo;t do things which you don&rsquo;t need for your
project</li>
<li>p 119: <strong>Hawtthorne Effect</strong> => people perform better when they&rsquo;re trying something new

<ul>
<li>if this effect should work for you, you have to make nonstandard approach the rule</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>p 126: <strong>The purpose of a team is not goal attainment but goal alignement</strong></li>
<li>p 133: 7 facts how to gain teamicide (idea is from deBono: rather than looking for ways to achieve
your goal, look for ways to achieve the exact opposite of your goal)

<ul>
<li>defensive management: ever have plan b in your aisles, Managers must trust in their people</li>
<li>bureaucracy: it hurts team formation and keep the people from the hard work</li>
<li>physical separation: don&rsquo;t separate the team on four floors but don&rsquo;t let people sit in the same
room who chat the whole time because they produce to much noise</li>
<li>fragmentation of people&rsquo;s time: don&rsquo;t be involved in to many projects because then you spend
your time in changing the gears</li>
<li>quality reduction of the product: the developing team hates this because they know they can do
better</li>
<li>phone deadlines: don&rsquo;t pressure your team because they know what it means</li>
<li>clique control</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>p 144: A person you can&rsquo;t trust with any autonomy is of no use for you</li>
<li>p 145: <strong>open Kimono Management</strong> => give trust to your people and that gives teams their best
chance to form</li>
<li>p 154: <strong>the essence of successful management</strong> is to get everyone pulling in the same direction
and then somehow get them fired up to the point that nothing, not even their manager, could stop
their progress</li>
<li>p 178: motivational posters with messages of the firm are disturbing</li>
<li>p 180: overtime damage team cohesion and has many negative effects on your team</li>
<li>p 182: to much competition is no good (nice example with siblings)</li>
<li>p 189: code defibrillator</li>
<li>p 191: The more you improve the way you go about work, the harder the work will be because

<ul>
<li>by improving the methods we move the more mundane work either into the machine or out of the
project entirely</li>
<li>improved methods allow you to take on more difficult challenges</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>p 195: And it should be considered that nothing is more difficult to handle, more doubtful of
success, nor more dangerous than to manage, than to put oneself at the head of introducing new
orders</li>
<li>p 196: Everything works and everything fails was the response &ndash; was the response on the question
about which tools would work in your organization and failed to become common practice</li>
<li>p 197: Mantra: <strong>The fundamental response to change is not logical, but emotional</strong></li>
<li>p 198: <strong>&ldquo;You never improve if you can&rsquo;t change at all&rdquo;</strong> Tom DeMarco</li>
<li>p 199: <strong>Satir Change Model</strong>: Old Status Quo => Chaos => Practice and Integration => New Status
Quo &ndash; so Chaos is an integral part of change</li>
<li>p 201: change only has a chance of succeeding if failure is also okay</li>
<li>p 210: learning is limited by an organization&rsquo;s ability to keep its people</li>
<li>p 222: what managers do best is making a community</li>
<li>p 223: Aristotle described interlinked Nobles Sciences that make a philosophy:

<ul>
<li>Metaphysics, Logic, Ethic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
