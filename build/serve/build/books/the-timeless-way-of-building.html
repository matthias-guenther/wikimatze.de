  <ul>
<li>p 7: good software can just made by people who are close to the subject</li>
<li>p 9: every person has the dream to create something great</li>
<li>p 11: &ldquo;patterns are emerging from certain combinator processes&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 14: &ldquo;like every living process, it is a pattern which builds order out of nothing&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 14–15: &ldquo;we are afraid of chaos and think of more methods will save us from that&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 16: fear solution => learn the relationship between ourselves and our surroundings</li>
<li>p 26: &ldquo;It is never twice the same, because it always take its shape from the particular place in which it occurs&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 26: &ldquo;A system has quality only if you have a feeling for it&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 36: <code>quality without a name</code>: when it fits some abstract image perfect</li>
<li>p 47: &ldquo;One man is free at that one instant when you see in him a certain smile and you know he is himself, and
perfectly at home within himself&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 48: &ldquo;Each of us faces the fear of letting go&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 49: If you are near your dead you are doing things against you feared every time so much</li>
<li>p 52; keep up the moments when a man is laughing because he is not on guard and his most important forces show
themselves</li>
<li>p 52: &ldquo;We cannot be aware of these most precious moments when they are actually happening&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 65 &ldquo;The equipment of a house changes the whole experience of a building&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 66: &ldquo;An unique event can change our lives completely (or leave its mark)&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 70: <code>action</code> and <code>space</code> are forming patterns of events in space</li>
<li>p 95: &ldquo;Each building gets its character from just the patterns which keep on repeating there&rdquo;</li>
<li><code>resume of chapter 5</code> (p 105): Every building and every town is made of patterns which repeat themselves throughout
its fabric, and that it gets its character from just those patterns of which it is made"</li>
<li>p 107: &ldquo;Play and eat together to become more productive&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 111: &ldquo;people are drawn to light&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 115: &ldquo;problems are conflicts for us&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 120: &ldquo;a pattern dies when it fails to provide a framework in which forces can resolve themselves&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 122: &ldquo;we have the quality without a name when we are most intense, most happy, most wholehearted&rdquo;</li>
<li>resume of chapter 6 (p 122):

<ul>
<li>The quality without a name in us, our liveliness, our thirst for life, depends directly on the patterns in the
world, and the extent to which they have this quality themselves</li>
<li>Patterns which live, release this quality in us</li>
<li>But they release this quality in us, essentially because they have it in themselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>p 129: &ldquo;through the process of adaption, we are destroying some other part of ourselves&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 134: &ldquo;A building in which all the patterns are alive has no disturbing forces&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 147: &ldquo;patterns repeat themselves but no configuration of the surroundings at anyplace and time is always the same&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 160: &ldquo;The quality of life is just like that: it cannot be made, but only generated&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 164: &ldquo;In each town , each building and each garden must be shaped by an autonomous process&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 166: &ldquo;Is a code, like the genetic code, fore human acts of building? Yes, it takes the form of language&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 174: &ldquo;each room is a little different according to the view&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 177: &ldquo;once you are persuaded that this is a good way to build floors, you go on doing it that way until you have
some reason to rethink it&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 182: &ldquo;each pattern is a rule which describes what you have to do to generate the entity which it defines.&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 191:

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;each person use the language a little differently&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;<strong>pattern language</strong> is a finite system of rules which a person can use to generate an infinite variety of
different buildings&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>p 199: &ldquo;architects are responsible for no more than perhaps 5 percent of all buildings in the world => the most come
from thousands of other people</li>
<li>p 201:&ldquo;Everybody follows rules of the thumb&rdquo;, if you have to fix something you follow a pattern</li>
<li>p 202:&ldquo;<strong>Your pattern language</strong> is the sum total of your knowledge&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 203: &ldquo;the pattern language in each mind is evolving all the time&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 206: &ldquo;Rules of English make you creative because they save you time using meaningless combinations of words&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 209: &ldquo;Why are patterns repeating themselves? Because people have a common language&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 223: &ldquo;The source of life which you create lies in the power of the language which you have&rdquo; => your language
generates the building which you make (same principle in software development)</li>
<li>p 231: &ldquo;in modern society pattern language dies because of specialized and private&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 233: &ldquo;people lost their confidence in their own judgment => other persuasive what is good for them&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 236: &ldquo;if you are design for others you are using simpler patterns&rdquo; =>off-shoring problem in software development</li>
<li>p 247: <strong>Def. pattern</strong> => relation between a certain context, a problem and a solution</li>
<li>p 253: <strong>Context => System of forces => Configuration</strong></li>
<li>p 261: &ldquo;patterns are like invariants even if there are millions of solutions for one problem&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 262: &ldquo;making abstractions which are powerful and deep is hard&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 267: &ldquo;if you can’t draw a diagram of the patterns, it isn’t a pattern&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 315: &ldquo;Each pattern is modified by its position in the language as a whole * p 338:"a living language must
constantly be re-created in each persons mind&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 343: &ldquo;a common pattern language is defined by a pool of patterns&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 353: &ldquo;A person with a pattern language can design any part of the environment&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 357: &ldquo;A building is also a constant flux of processes&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 364: &ldquo;In a town a pattern language is the source of life, above all, because it helps to generate the wholes, from
the cooperations of individual acts&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 377: &ldquo;Use patterns in a certain order to avoid contradictions&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 382: &ldquo;<strong>The sequence of the patterns for a design is the key to that design</strong>&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 383: &ldquo;<strong>You really understand what you are doing for the first time at the moment when the sequence of the patterns
becomes clear to you</strong>&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 422: &ldquo;I never made drawing of the builds => the design was done completely in my mind&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 425: &ldquo;if you spend more than a couple of hours or days to design a house, you know it is tricky ‘designed’ and no
longer organic&rdquo; don’t spend to much time on software design</li>
<li>p 460: The details of a building cannot be made alive when they are made from modular parts"</li>
<li>p 463: &ldquo;When the spider builds its web, the process is standardized but the parts which are created are all different&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 479: &ldquo;Our predictions are invariable wrong. People use builds differently from the way they thought they would&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 539: &ldquo;A man who is not afraid to die, is free to live because he is open to what happens next and is not always
killing it by trying to control it&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 544: &ldquo;<strong>By following the language you feel free to escape from the artificial images which society has imposed upon
you. And, as you escape from these images, and the need to manufacture things according to these images, you are able
to come more into touch with the simple reality of things, and thereby become ego less and free.</strong>&rdquo;</li>
<li>p 546: state of mind is obscured by images and ideas and theories, which make it impossible for you to be yourself or
act as nature does. But you have been told so much, that you no longer value these inner impulses</li>
