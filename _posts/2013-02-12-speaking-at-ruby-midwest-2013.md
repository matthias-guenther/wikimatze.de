I received notification that my talk proposal for [Ruby Midwest 2013](http://www.rubymidwest.com/) has been accepted.
My talk **"More time for Open Source work with the help of the Pomodoro Technique"** will show you how you can do more
Open Source work besides your day job and other liabilities. I'm very excited, as this will be my first time giving a
talk at a conference.


[Ruby Midwest 2013](http://www.rubymidwest.com/) will be held in [Kansas City](http://www.kansascity.com/), 5th and 6th
of April. [Michael Feather](http://www.twitter.com/mfeathers) and [James Edward Grey II](http://www.twitter.com/JEG2) are giving keynotes and I will receive the opportunity to meet them.
 If you attent the conference as well, let us get in touch.
