I attended the [**Global Coderetreat**](http://coderetreat.org/) event initialized by
[Corey Haines](http://coreyhaines.com/). The general purpose of this event was to get a bunch of
hackers together to implement [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).

## Setting up goals

As **J. B. Rainsberger** mentioned in his
[article](http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design) four elements of
simple design, it is best to setup goals for your retreat to get most out of it. Here is a list of
what I achieved in each session:


1. Being a mentor of TDD: I taught [dedan](https://github.com/dedan) how to use TDD, why TDD helps you to think about your design.
2. Being a mentor of BDD: Showing a fellow Rubyist how to do BDD.
3. Doing something completely stupid: I played *evil coder* and *ping-pong pairing* with [@tilosoenke](http://twitter.com/#!/tilosoenke) - we couldn't communicate with words, only with code, one writing tests and other the implementation of the tests.
4. Discuss about names: We said together and discussed about right names for methods, variables, and classes. We concluded that good names saves you scary comments in your code.
5. Explain Ruby to a Java-Programmer.
6. Being mentored about Lisp: We solved the whole 'Game of Live' in common [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) , while [@HansHuebener](http://twitter.com/#!/hanshuebner) explained me the strength and beauty Common Lisp.


## Conclusion

It was great to get so many people with so many different skills and mindsets together, exchange experience and
encouraging others to try something new. I will definitely have a closer look on Lisp to enhance my Ruby programming
style.
