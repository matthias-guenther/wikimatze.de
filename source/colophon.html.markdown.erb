This website is written by various technologies: [bulma CSS framework](https://bulma.io/ "bulma CSS framework") for the responsive layout, [rsync](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync "rsync") for deploying, [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "markdown") the format in which I'm writing blog posts, [sweetie gem](https://github.com/wikimatze/sweetie "sweetie gem") for gathering different information of the website like last build date, [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/ "middleman") for creating the website, and [hashover](https://github.com/jacobwb/hashover "hashover") for the comments.

For fast hacking and creating new blog posts on the fly [Vim](http://www.vim.org "vim") is my advocate.
