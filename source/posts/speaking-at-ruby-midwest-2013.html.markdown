I received notification that my talk proposal for Ruby Midwest 2013 has been accepted.  My talk **"More time for Open Source work with the help of the Pomodoro Technique"** will show you how you can do more Open Source work besides your day job and other liabilities. I'm very excited, as this will be my first time giving a talk at a conference.


Ruby Midwest 2013 will be held in Kansas City, 5th and 6th of April. [Michael Feather](https://www.twitter.com/mfeathers) and [James Edward Grey II](https://www.twitter.com/JEG2) are giving keynotes and I will receive the opportunity to meet them.  If you attend the conference as well, let us get in touch.
