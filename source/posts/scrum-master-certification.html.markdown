I had the pleasure to become a [Certified ScrumMaster](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/gmatthias "Certified ScrumMaster") and did an advanced Certified ScrumMaster workshop at [it-agile](http://www.it-agile.de/ "it-agile") in Hamburg. Before and after the coaching (and even) before, you have to prepare yourself for the exam and learn more Scrum.


- Read the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrum.org/Scrum-Guide "Scrum Guide") by [Ken Schwaber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Schwaber "Ken Schwaber") and [Jeff Sutherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Sutherland "Jeff Sutherland").

- Widen your horizon under the [scrum.org forum](https://www.scrum.org/Forums "scrum.org forum").
- During the test, don't try to google questions, because they can differ from the questions you experience, since scrum evolves older questions gets outdated.
- The test is based on [CSM Content Outline Learning Objectives](http://www.scrumalliance.org/scrum/media/ScrumAllianceMedia/Files%20and%20PDFs/Certifications/CSM/CSM-Content-Outline-Learning-Objectives.pdf "CSM Content Outline Learning Objectives") make sure to get through these questions and be able to answer them.

Since I'm a person who better learns through learning I created my [scrum notes in German](/scrum.pdf "scrum notes in German"). If you have additions or notes, you can find the sources on [GitHub](https://github.com/wikimatze/scrum "GitHub").
