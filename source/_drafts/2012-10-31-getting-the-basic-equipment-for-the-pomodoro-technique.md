title: Getting the Basic Equipment For The Pomodoro Technique
meta-description: Learn what tools you need to get started with mastering the Pomodoro Technique
---

*This article series describes the necessary steps for becoming a "Self Certified Pomodoro Master". Having the
right tools for doing your Pomodoro is an essential step in getting started with the technique.  I will explain each tool in detail and
will tell you what worked best and how I'm using them.*


## The Timer

The key thing to get you started with the Pomodoro Technique is a timer. Take your time and choose something you really
love and embrace, because you will spend a lot of time with it. Using this timer, you will work for 25 minutes - one
Pomodoro. It is important that the tool of your choice is able to produce sounds when the Pomodoro is over. This helps
you to work in a time-boxed manner and to stop working when the Pomodoro is over.


There are nearly endless kitchen you can chose from. To name a few one:


**1. Mechanical Helpers**

- A classical stop clock from your last running competitions back in your old school day. If you plan to do an
  [Ironman Triathlon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_Triathlon "Ironman") you may want to track your time and
  progress during the preparations for it.
- The lovely kitchen timer - your spouse's (ask before you grab it to avoud being hurt). Under
  [squidoo](http://www.squidoo.com/cool-kitchen-timers/ "squidoo") you can find a wide range of timers.
- Arduino-based timers: I have seen [Jim Weirich](https://de.twitter.com/jimweirich "Jim Weirich") build some awesome stuff
  with the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/ "Arduino") which raises a flag when a time interval is over - just watch this
  [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vGBuYhvsrs). If you want to learn
  more about Arduino check out the [book](http://pragprog.com/book/msard/arduino "Arduino book") by the Pragmatic
  Bookshelf).

**2. Digital Helpers**

- Wrist watch: I'm not a wristwatch wearer but if you are, this is a very handy timer, because it is
  always close at hand. I've heard of people who uses *smartwatches*; one like
  [i'm Watch](http://www.imwatch.it/us-en/ "I'm watch") should do a good job in timing Pomodoros.
- Cellphones: I still own a classical Nokia cellphone and it runs and runs ...
- Smart phones: Apple ([iTouch](http://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/ "iTouch")/
  [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/ "iPhone")), or Android based ([Galaxy
  Note](http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/galaxynote/ "Galaxy Note"),
  [Nexus](http://www.google.de/nexus/ "Nexus").
- Tablets: Apple's [iPad](http://www.apple.com/de/ipad/), or Amazon's
  [Kindle Fire HD](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Fire-HD/dp/B0083PWAPW "Kindle Fire HD").

**3. Software Helpers**

- Editor build-in: Vim plugin [vim-pomodoro](https://github.com/mnick/vim-pomodoro "Vim Pomodoro plugin"), Emacs
  plugin [pomodoro.el](https://github.com/vderyagin/pomodoro.el "Emacs Pomodoro plugin").
- Browser plugin: for Chrome use
  [StayFocused](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji "StayFocused")
  plugin, and for Firefox use [Simple Timer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/simple-timer/ "Simple
  Timer") plugin.
- [Pomo gem](https://github.com/visionmedia/pomo "Pomo Gem"): This is a command-line plugin to manage your Pomodoros.

Once you've selected and acquired your timer, use it! Try working in 25-minute blocks, timed by your timer, as much as
possible so that it becomes natural to you work with it besides you.


In using the original kitchen timer at home, I trained my brain to the ticking sound. Whenever I hear it I'm getting
deeply into the task, tuning out music, incoming emails, or other distractions. I'm feeling like Nero in Matrix when he
is moving in Bullet Time to avoid projectiles (in our case: distractions). Of course it would be better to turn of all
of the distraction before starting the Pomodoro, but that's not generally realistic and besides (yay!), I'm training
myself to get into this mindset even at work where I have distractions the whole time.


I prefer to use the kitchen timer at home and not at work, I don't want to annoy my coworkers, and there are some who
wants to work in absolutely silence. I have to respect this.


Getting used to the kitchen-timer-working-mode was no problem for me. I was working time-boxed before knowing the
Pomodoro Technique, but without taking any breaks. That's a problem of programmers: your brain needs time for recreation
as mentioned in
[Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](http://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning "Pragmatic Thinking and Learning") by Andy Hunt.
With the help of the Pomodoro Technique I'm still feeling energized to keep on writing a book or do open source work
after a long working day. Of course, being passionate about what you do is very important too.
The [Pomodoro Book](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/book/ "Pomodoro Book") suggests that the most important part in life are breaks. The time offline gives you time for self-reflection and thinking about yourself.


## To-Do-Today Sheet

After the timer, the nex tool you need is a To-Do-Today Sheet. This list is like an ordinary to-do list that everybody uses (even if you are just going to the supermarket to buy
food). But crucially, it's only a list of items you want to finish *for the current day*. The idea behind this is to have a
plan about what you want to accomplish today, and not be overwhelmed or discouraged by the size of the entire project.


<a href="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8499/8277555195_c7069867a6_b.jpg" title="Example of a To-Do-Today Sheet." class="fancybox"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8499/8277555195_c7069867a6_z.jpg" class="center" alt="Example of a To-Do-Today Sheet."/></a>
<div class="Example of a To-Do-Today Sheet."></div>


Since at work we are using [Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development) "Scrum"), we are organizing our
tasks on post-its. Post-its are like the small items of the To-Do-Today Sheet.


At home, when working on private project or open source, I have a big collection of to-dos tagged with certain terms in
my *collect.txt* file. Here is a small example of it:


        TODO @mail write scott@leanpub.com about their T-Shirt I got
        TODO @git repair missing _config.yml
        TODO @setup add tmux shorctuts in the readme
        DONE @git understand git add --edit 2012-10-21
        DONE @pmwiki integrate the changes made by Simon (check mail) 2012-10-14
        DONE @proposal https://github.com/rubyaustralia/rubyconfau-2013-cfp 2012-10-14


## Activity Inventory Sheet

Another tool you need to be a Pomodoro Master in an Activity Inventory Sheet.  This is the backlog of all the items you
want work on.


During my working time we are ordering all our tasks on the
Scrumboard. So everybody in the organization can see what we are working on. It's like an inventory of the things that
needs to be done to finish a new software feature.


At home or on side projects I'm using my global tagged to-do list in a simple text-file an not on a piece of paper. I
did this because I ran into serious issues with managing so many different papers, and one day I just threwthem in the
trash can and converted the list in a text-file.


As you can see I'm not using the things exactly as described in the Pomodoro book. I'm taking what I need and adapting
existing things.


<a href="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8200/8277557803_52f4decdae_b.jpg" title="Example of an Inventory Sheet." class="fancybox"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8200/8277557803_52f4decdae_z.jpg" class="center" alt="Example of an Inventory Sheet."/></a>
<div class="Example of an Activity Inventory Sheet."></div>


My Inventory Sheet is like my basement: It's a big pile of things (task) that needs a space and ends up in mess. At
first I was gathering so many unnecessary things that my Inventory Sheet looked like a garbage dump. If that's what you
want find youself doing, stop and clean it up every week, like you would clean your house. Keep the things you really
need and get rid of the clutter.


## Record Sheet

Done right, the Pomodoro Technique will give you insight into how long things take, and help you to plan your work. The
Record Sheet is the tool that enables you to measure the number Pomodoros you need for a piece of work. Simply multiply
the number of Pomodoros per task with 25 minutes and you get your working-time.


I'm not recording my time and a sheet of paper. Instead I'm using [slimtimer](http://slimtimer.com/ "Slimtimer") for
tracking this data.


<a href="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8351/8279131430_7c2c2d6301_b.jpg" title="Slimtimer - tracking your time paperless." class="fancybox"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8351/8279131430_7c2c2d6301_z.jpg" class="center" alt="Slimtimer - tracking your time paperless."/></a>
<div class="Slimtimer - tracking your time paperless."></div>


Why should you track the time?. In order to become better with your time management. For example, I take a close look
at the end of each week to see where I spend my time. Also, if you are freelancing, you may need to keep track about how many
hours you spend on a client project. Don't forget: Time is your most valuable asset


## Conclusion

As you can see, you don't beed much to start started with the Pomodoro Technique. That's by design. The technique should be
easy to learn and should be performed with the objects you already have. In the next article, we'll look at how to use
the Pomodoro Technique to estimate how long tasks will take - and how to successively improve estimates.

But the timer indicates that our time is up for this installment. I was blessed to be able t to meet
Francesco here in Berlin during the first
[Pomodoro Meetup](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/page/pomodoro-meetup-berlin-1/), where I got my starter-pack consisting of the lovely Pomodoro timer
and a T-Shirt which says that I love my time.
