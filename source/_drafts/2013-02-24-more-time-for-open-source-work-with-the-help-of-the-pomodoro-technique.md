## What means Open Source?

which the source code is made available, free of charge, to all interested parties; further users have the right to
modify and extend the program.

http://opensource.org/docs/osd


## Is it really free?


    "There is no such thing as a free lunch." -  Milton Friedman


This is the same with OSS, normally no support, not so good documentation, no gurantess that it will work. Not in the
Ruby community. We love to contribute and write tutorials about the stuff we build.

Yes we are awesome and so you are

But what we all miss is time. Enough time for our beloved projects ...

## Motivation For Programmers Doing OSS

Why should proggers invest time and effort in working for free?

- acquire reputation which is rewarded in the job market
- peer recognition and identification with the goals of the project



## When Can Open Source Work

Good software arises when one or more very good programmers work closely full time together over a period of time
developing, maintaining and improving it.


## The Problems Of Open Source

- We are not close together, living in different time zones at different places
- Improving code
- Having a great team is one fact but you also need to keep them together.
- documentation => make is easy to write documentation for your project
- expertise problem => mailing lists, wiki, project site, reward people, bring them together on a hacking event => all solved with GitHub
- There are phases in our life where we just can't do all the nice things we would like to do


I must conclude, that the only problem we have is time. This is where the Pomodoro Technique comes into.
