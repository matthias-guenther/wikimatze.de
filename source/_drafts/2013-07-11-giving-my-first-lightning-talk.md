title: Giving My First Lightning Talk
description:

*Giving a lighting talk is in some way more complex than giving a longer talk. In this article I'll give you
some adive which help you to do your talk in this format.*

## Be spontaneus
*I began giving my first great talk at RubyMidwest in April 2013 this year (TBD, reference). After this event it became
very silent around me for giving talks. I somekind had fear to put too much effort in a talk again. I kept
writing blog posts around Padrino and wrote a Z shell completion for it. I learned so much about it that I wanted to
share it to a wider audience. So I decided spontaneusly to do a lightning talk about it. This has two benefits: Firstly, I could
speak again about a topic I love without spending to much time into the preparation and secondly, I had to learn how to
do a lightning talk. I spend one evening to prepare my mind for reading various blog post with tips for giving a
lightning talk.*


## The Slides

*Don't put too much effort in your slides - five minutes are not a long. You have to get rid of anything fluos like who
you are, your background etc. You have to make clear what your message is and if you are using slides don't try to take
more than five. *


## The Talk

When your are going to give your talk you have two options: You can practise your talk a couple of times, read out the
main points loudly
