- p 23: "Every good work of software starts by scratching a developers personal itch."
- p 24: "Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse)."
- p 26: "If you know the right attitude, interesting problems will find you."
- p 27: "Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective
  debugging."
- p 30: Linux Law: "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"
- p 31: Delphi Effect -> the averaged opinion of a mass of equally expert (or equally ignorant) observers is quite a bit
  more reliable predictor than the opinion of a single randomly chosen observer
- p 38: "If you treat your beta-testers as if they're you most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your
  most valuable resource."
- p 40: "Often the most striking and innovative solutions came from realizing that your concept of the problem was
  wrong."
- p 41: "Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more
  to take away."
- p 44: "Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected."
- p 49: the best hacks starts out as personal solutions to the authors everyday problems
- p 57: **resource marshalling** -> different parts in your organization want your software development people
- p 77: John Lockes theory of property -> is an explanation if the ownership of a projects changes -> on a frontier,
  where lands exists that has never had an owner, one can acquire ownership by **homesteading**, mixing one's labor with
  the unowned land, fencing it, and defending one's title
- p 85: hackerdom means *maximizing reputation incentives*
- p 94: **"You become a hacker when other hackers call you a hacker."**
- p 120: "Software is largely a service industry operating under the persistent but unfounded delusion that it is a
  manufacturing industry"
