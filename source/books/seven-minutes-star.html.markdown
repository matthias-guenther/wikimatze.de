## custom notes taken on my own observation

- the difference between speakers is energy -> without energy you can't amaze the people
- separate question and answers from the talk, because if you can't answer questions during your talk, you will lose
  authority solution: talk to the person of the talk and make it possible to delay the section of QA after the talk
- a slide which has two message should be placed on two slides
