## Outline

As long as your application exists and developers will leave and new ones will take apart in your team. It's good to have some metrics about certain code smell. A code smells are part of your source code which may be the root of a design problem but are no actually bug. It's good to have some tools to be "lord of the smells" for http://www.padrinorb.com - don't let smells lower the quality of your project.

You can find code examples and how set up the metrics under http://wikimatze.de/code-coverage-tools-for-padrino/
